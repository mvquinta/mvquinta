### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Miguel Quinta, a front-end developer and a curious one about mobile.
Former 3D Artist, I embraced a career change looking to fullfill both my personal and professional needs. Been running long side different technologies all my life. Now, as developer, I live among them.

Being self-taught, I've been constantly learning over the past few months building, along the way, 1+Password (Android App) and 1+Pomodoro (Web App).

I'm currently working on my personal website but already with my eyes on my next personal project.

Currently learning, well, everything! 
Lately I've been working with React and loving it. But everyday I learn and train more and more all my JavaScript, HTML and CSS knowledges and foundations.

I'm looking for an entry position to learn and gain professional experience. I want to give the next step with, on my back, all the experience I gathered over several productions and my eager to grow.
